# Diabetic-Retinopathy

An image classifier to detect and classify cases of Diabetic Retinopathy using FastAI. This project was done as part of the Kaggle Competition [APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/aptos2019-blindness-detection) challenge.

#### Setting up

We use [FastAI](https://www.fast.ai/) for our deep learning library. Run the following code to install FastAI in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
```bash
curl -s https://course.fast.ai/setup/colab | bash
```
You can download the dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/aptos2019-blindness-detection/data).

Check out this [notebook](https://github.com/ashwindasr/Diabetic-Retinopathy/blob/master/diabetic-retinopathy-demo.ipynb) on how to train the model.

To see the classifier in action, see this [notebook](https://github.com/ashwindasr/Diabetic-Retinopathy/blob/master/diabetic-retinopathy-demo.ipynb).
